# DecisionTree-Example

## What is Decision Tree?
Dicision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification problems. 
The algorithm uses training data to create rules that can be presented by tree structure.

## Advantages of Decision Tree
There are some advantages of using a decision tree:

* The decision tree is a white-box model. We can easily understand any particular condition of the model which results 
in either true or false.
* It can handle both continuous and categorical data.

## Disadvantages of Decision Tree
Some disadvantages of the decision tree:
* Decision Tree may become very large and complex with a large number of attributes.
* A decision tree at times can be sensitive to the training data, a very small variation in data can lead to a completely
different tree structure.
